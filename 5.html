        <p style="text-align:center">London is the capital of England
        
                Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary
                 leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded
                  by the Romans.[8] The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2)
                 and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits.
                 [9][10][11][12][13][note 1] The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status.
                  Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[14][note 2][15]</p>

        <p style="text-align: center">Delhi is the capital of India
                Delhi (/ˈdɛli/, Hindi pronunciation: [dɪlliː] Dillī, Punjabi pronunciation: [dɪlliː] Dillī, Urdu pronunciation:
                 [dɛhliː] Dehlī), officially the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT), is a city and a union territory of 
                 India containing New Delhi, the capital of India.[17][18] It is bordered by Haryana on three sides and by 
                 Uttar Pradesh to the east. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi). According to the 
                 2011 census, Delhi's city proper population was over 11 million,[7] the second-highest in India after Mumbai
                 ,[19] while the whole NCT's population was about 16.8 million.[8] Delhi's urban area is now considered to extend
                  beyond the NCT boundaries and include the neighboring satellite cities of Faridabad, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad and 
                  Noidan an area now called Central National Capital Region (CNCR) and had an estimated 2016 population of over
                   26 million people, making it the world's second-largest urban area according to United Nations.[9] As of 2016,
                    recent estimates of the metro economy of its urban area have ranked Delhi either the most or second-most 
                    productive metro area of India.[13][12][20][14] Delhi is the second-wealthiest city in India after Mumbai, 
                    with a total private wealth of $450 billion and is home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires

        <h2 id="myheader"  class="cities">Tokyo</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center">Tokyo is the capital of
                Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, English: /ˈtoʊkioʊ/,[8] Japanese: [toːkʲoː] (About this soundlisten); lit. "Eastern Capital"), 
                officially Tokyo Metropolis (東京都 Tōkyō-to), one of the 47 prefectures of Japan, has served as the Japanese capital 
                since 1869.[9][10] As of 2018, the Greater Tokyo Area ranked as the most populous metropolitan area in the world.[11] 
                The urban area houses the seat of the Emperor of Japan, of the Japanese government and of the National Diet. Tokyo 
                forms part of the Kantō region on the southeastern side of Japan's main island, Honshu, and includes the Izu Islands 
                and Ogasawara Islands.[12] Tokyo was formerly named Edo when Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 
                1603. It became the capital after Emperor Meiji moved his seat to the city from Kyoto in 1868; at that time Edo was 
                renamed Tokyo. Tokyo Metropolis formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and 
                the city of Tokyo (東京市 Tōkyō-shi). Tokyo is often referred to as a city but is officially known and governed as 
                a "metropolitan prefecture", which differs from and combines elements of a city and a prefecture, a characteristic 
                unique to Tokyo.</p>
